pari-scm
========

Lisp bindings for Pari for a few different lisps.
Currently planned are

 - Racket: http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/intro.html
 - Common Lisp: http://common-lisp.net/project/cffi/manual/html_node/Tutorial.html

It seems Guile requires the bindings to be written in C, which is a
considerable disadvantage.
